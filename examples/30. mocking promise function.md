To write test cases for your saga function by mocking `fetchQuoteSearchApi` using Jest, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Setup Jest**: Make sure Jest is installed and configured in your project. If not, install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

2. **Mock `axios` or `fetchQuoteSearchApi`**: Since `fetchQuoteSearchApi` uses `axios` to make the HTTP request, you can either mock `axios` directly or mock the `fetchQuoteSearchApi` function itself.

3. **Write Test Cases**: Write tests to cover the expected behavior of your saga, including successful API calls and handling API errors.

### Mocking `fetchQuoteSearchApi`

For this example, let's mock `fetchQuoteSearchApi` directly. This approach provides more control over the responses and behaviors you want to simulate.

### Example Test Cases

```javascript
// sagas.test.js
import { runSaga } from "redux-saga";
import { fetchQuoteSearchSaga } from "./sagas"; // Adjust the import according to your project structure
import { fetchQuoteSearchApi } from "./api"; // Adjust the import according to your project structure
import { QUOTE_SEARCH_SUCCESS, QUOTE_SEARCH_FAILURE } from "./actions";

// Mock the API call
jest.mock("./api", () => ({
  fetchQuoteSearchApi: jest.fn(),
}));

describe("fetchQuoteSearchSaga", () => {
  it("should handle successfully fetching the quote search", async () => {
    const dispatchedActions = [];

    const mockedData = { data: "some data" };
    fetchQuoteSearchApi.mockImplementation(() => Promise.resolve(mockedData));

    const fakeStore = {
      dispatch: (action) => dispatchedActions.push(action),
      getState: () => ({}),
    };

    await runSaga(fakeStore, fetchQuoteSearchSaga).toPromise();

    expect(fetchQuoteSearchApi).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    expect(dispatchedActions).toContainEqual({
      type: QUOTE_SEARCH_SUCCESS,
      payload: mockedData.data,
    });
  });

  it("should handle errors in fetching the quote search", async () => {
    const dispatchedActions = [];

    const error = "An error occurred";
    fetchQuoteSearchApi.mockImplementation(() => Promise.reject(new Error(error)));

    const fakeStore = {
      dispatch: (action) => dispatchedActions.push(action),
      getState: () => ({}),
    };

    await runSaga(fakeStore, fetchQuoteSearchSaga).toPromise();

    expect(fetchQuoteSearchApi).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    expect(dispatchedActions).toContainEqual({
      type: QUOTE_SEARCH_FAILURE,
      payload: error,
    });
  });
});
```

### Explanation

- **Mocking `fetchQuoteSearchApi`**: We mock `fetchQuoteSearchApi` to control its behavior in each test case, simulating success and failure scenarios.
- **Test Case for Success**: We simulate a successful API call by making `fetchQuoteSearchApi` resolve with mock data. We then assert that the saga dispatched the `QUOTE_SEARCH_SUCCESS` action with the expected payload.
- **Test Case for Failure**: We simulate a failed API call by making `fetchQuoteSearchApi` reject with an error. We then assert that the saga dispatched the `QUOTE_SEARCH_FAILURE` action with the expected error message.

By following these steps and adjusting the code snippets according to your project's structure, you can effectively write test cases for your Redux-Saga functions, ensuring they handle both successful and failed API requests as expected.
