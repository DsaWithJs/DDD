To improve the `calculatePercentageChange` function without hardcoding "increase" and "decrease" directly within the function logic, you can use a more dynamic approach. One way to make the function more adaptable and maintainable is by using an object or enum to define potential variants. This can help encapsulate the logic for determining the variant based on the calculated difference and make the function more scalable.

### Using Enums in TypeScript

You can use an enum to define the variants. This makes the code more readable and reduces errors associated with direct string manipulation. Here’s how you can refactor the function using TypeScript enums:

```typescript
enum Variant {
  Increase = "increase",
  Decrease = "decrease",
  NoChange = "no change",
}

/**
 * Calculates the percentage change in sales between two months and determines the variant.
 * @param currentSales The sales amount for the current month.
 * @param previousSales The sales amount for the previous month.
 * @returns An object containing the percentage change as a string (without a sign) and the variant.
 */
function calculatePercentageChange(currentSales: number, previousSales: number): { percentage: string; variant: Variant } {
  // Handle the special case where both current and previous sales are zero
  if (currentSales === 0 && previousSales === 0) {
    return { percentage: "0%", variant: Variant.NoChange };
  }

  // Handle the case where previous sales are zero but current sales are greater than zero
  if (previousSales === 0 && currentSales > 0) {
    return { percentage: "100%", variant: Variant.Increase };
  }

  // Handle the case where current sales are zero but previous sales are greater than zero
  if (currentSales === 0 && previousSales > 0) {
    return { percentage: "100%", variant: Variant.Decrease };
  }

  // Calculate the difference between current and previous sales
  const difference: number = currentSales - previousSales;

  // Calculate the absolute percentage change
  const percentageChange: number = Math.abs((difference / previousSales) * 100);

  // Determine the variant based on the sign of the difference
  const variant: Variant = difference > 0 ? Variant.Increase : Variant.Decrease;

  // Format the percentage change to two decimal places
  const formattedPercentage: string = percentageChange.toFixed(2) + "%";

  // Return the formatted percentage change and variant
  return { percentage: formattedPercentage, variant };
}

// Example usage:
const currentMonthSales: number = 0;
const previousMonthSales: number = 5657;
console.log(calculatePercentageChange(currentMonthSales, previousMonthSales));
```

### Benefits of Using Enums:

1. **Code Readability:** Enums make the code more readable and understandable. It's clear what the possible variants are without needing to dig into the function logic.
2. **Maintenance and Scalability:** If new variants need to be added or modified, you can simply update the `Variant` enum. This centralizes changes and makes them straightforward to manage.
3. **Error Reduction:** Using enums can help reduce bugs related to typos in strings since TypeScript will check enum values at compile time.

This approach aligns well with best practices in TypeScript and enhances the maintainability of your code. It’s particularly beneficial in larger projects where such enums can be shared and reused across multiple components or services.
