To add TypeScript support to your `recentActivity` utility, you can define TypeScript interfaces for the specific types of payloads that `setMobile`, `setShoes`, and `setWatches` will handle. This helps ensure type safety and makes the interactions with these functions more predictable and error-resistant.

### Step 1: Define TypeScript Interfaces

Start by defining interfaces for the payloads of mobiles, shoes, and watches. Each interface will describe the structure of the data expected for those specific product types:

```typescript
interface MobileDetails {
  modelName: string;
  storage: string;
  color: string;
}

interface ShoeDetails {
  brand: string;
  size: number;
  color: string;
}

interface WatchDetails {
  brand: string;
  material: string;
  warranty: string;
}
```

### Step 2: Modify the `storeActivity` Function

Ensure the `storeActivity` function can accept these types as part of its payload argument. You also need to make sure the function itself is type-safe:

```typescript
function storeActivity(type: string, payload: MobileDetails | ShoeDetails | WatchDetails) {
  const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleString();
  const activity = { type, payload, timestamp };

  let activities: Array<{ type: string; payload: any; timestamp: string }> = [];
  try {
    activities = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("recentActivities") || "[]");
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Error reading from localStorage:", e);
  }

  activities.push(activity);

  try {
    localStorage.setItem("recentActivities", JSON.stringify(activities));
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Error writing to localStorage:", e);
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Define the `recentActivity` Object with Methods

Here, you explicitly type the function parameters to ensure only the correct data structures can be passed:

```typescript
const recentActivity = {
  setMobile(details: MobileDetails) {
    storeActivity("mobile", details);
  },
  setShoes(details: ShoeDetails) {
    storeActivity("shoes", details);
  },
  setWatches(details: WatchDetails) {
    storeActivity("watches", details);
  },
};
```

### Example Usage

Now, when using `recentActivity`, TypeScript will enforce that the correct data types are used, reducing bugs:

```typescript
recentActivity.setMobile({
  modelName: "iPhone 13",
  storage: "256GB",
  color: "Black",
});

recentActivity.setShoes({
  brand: "Nike",
  size: 10,
  color: "Red",
});

recentActivity.setWatches({
  brand: "Rolex",
  material: "Gold",
  warranty: "5 years",
});
```

### Benefits of Using TypeScript

- **Type Safety**: Errors related to incorrect data types can be caught at compile-time, making the codebase more robust and easier to debug.
- **Code Autocompletion**: TypeScript provides better tooling support, including autocompletion and inline documentation in most code editors.
- **Scalability**: It's easier to maintain and scale the codebase as it grows, because TypeScriptâ€™s type system ensures that components fit together correctly.

This setup ensures that your `recentActivity` utility is well-structured and type-safe, leveraging TypeScript's capabilities to enhance code quality and maintainability.
