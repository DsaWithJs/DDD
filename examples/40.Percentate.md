To add TypeScript support to the JavaScript function you have, we'll add type annotations and make sure the function adheres to best practices for TypeScript coding. This will include specifying the types for the parameters and the return type for the function. Here's how you can implement this:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the percentage change in sales between two months.
 * @param currentSales The sales amount for the current month.
 * @param previousSales The sales amount for the previous month.
 * @returns A string representing the percentage change, positive or negative.
 */
function calculatePercentageChange(currentSales: number, previousSales: number): string {
  // Handle the special case where both current and previous sales are zero
  if (currentSales === 0 && previousSales === 0) {
    return "0%"; // No change if both are zero
  }

  // Handle the case where previous sales are zero but current sales are greater than zero
  if (previousSales === 0 && currentSales > 0) {
    return ">100%"; // Indicates more than 100% increase from zero
  }

  // Calculate the difference between current and previous sales
  const difference: number = currentSales - previousSales;

  // Calculate the percentage change
  const percentageChange: number = (difference / previousSales) * 100;

  // Format the percentage change to two decimal places
  const formattedPercentage: string = percentageChange.toFixed(2);

  // Return the formatted percentage change
  return `${formattedPercentage}%`;
}

// Example usage:
const currentMonthSales: number = 10349;
const previousMonthSales: number = 5657;
console.log(calculatePercentageChange(currentMonthSales, previousMonthSales));
```

### TypeScript Enhancements:

1. **Type Annotations:** Parameters `currentSales` and `previousSales` are explicitly typed as `number`, and the function return type is specified as `string`.

2. **Explicit Variable Typing:** Local variables such as `difference`, `percentageChange`, and `formattedPercentage` are explicitly typed for clarity and to leverage TypeScript's type checking.

3. **Error Handling and Edge Cases:** Since negative values are ruled out by your conditions, no additional error handling for negative values is necessary. The function is tailored to handle zero values effectively.

This TypeScript version ensures strong typing, which can help with error detection during development, especially in larger projects where types can prevent many common mistakes.
