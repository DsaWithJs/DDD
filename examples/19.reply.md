To create an interface in TypeScript that extends `FastifyReply` and includes a response object of the specified type, you first need to define the structure of the response object using TypeBox or a TypeScript interface, and then extend `FastifyReply` to include a method or property that returns this type of object.

Here's an example of how to do this:

1. **Define the Response Object Structure**:

   You can use TypeBox to define the structure of the response object as you've provided. Alternatively, you can define it as a TypeScript interface. I'll show you both ways.

   Using TypeBox:

   ```javascript
   const { Type } = require("@sinclair/typebox");

   const ResponseObjectType = Type.Object({
     createdUser: Type.String(),
     updatedUser: Type.String(),
     createdDate: Type.String(),
     updatedDate: Type.String(),
     submitDate: Type.Null(),
     reviewDate: Type.Null(),
     id: Type.String(),
     status: Type.String(),
     requestSource: Type.String(),
     accountId: Type.String(),
     accountName: Type.String(),
     accountContact: Type.String(),
     salesType: Type.String(),
   });
   ```

   Using TypeScript interface:

   ```typescript
   interface ResponseObject {
     createdUser: string;
     updatedUser: string;
     createdDate: string;
     updatedDate: string;
     submitDate: null;
     reviewDate: null;
     id: string;
     status: string;
     requestSource: string;
     accountId: string;
     accountName: string;
     accountContact: string;
     salesType: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Extend `FastifyReply`**:

   Next, extend `FastifyReply` to include a method or property for the response. In most cases, you don't need to extend `FastifyReply` for typical response handling, as you can specify the response schema directly in your route definition. However, if you need to extend it for custom functionality, here's an example:

   ```typescript
   import { FastifyReply } from "fastify";

   interface CustomFastifyReply extends FastifyReply {
     customSend: (payload: ResponseObject) => void;
   }
   ```

   In this interface, `CustomFastifyReply` extends `FastifyReply` and adds a new method `customSend` which expects a payload of type `ResponseObject`.

3. **Usage in a Route Handler**:

   Hereâ€™s an example of how you might use `CustomFastifyReply` in a route handler:

   ```typescript
   app.get("/some-route", async (request, reply: CustomFastifyReply) => {
     const responseObject: ResponseObject = {
       // ... populate the fields
     };
     reply.customSend(responseObject);
   });
   ```

   In this route handler, `reply` is typed as `CustomFastifyReply`, which includes the `customSend` method.

Remember, extending `FastifyReply` is typically done for advanced use cases. For standard API responses, Fastify's built-in reply methods and response schema validation are usually sufficient.
