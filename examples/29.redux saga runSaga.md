To write test cases for the `fetchQuoteDetailsSaga` function using Redux-Saga's testing utilities and Jest, you'll follow a pattern where you mock API calls and state selections, then assert that the saga performs the expected effects like calling APIs, selecting from the state, and dispatching actions based on different scenarios.

First, ensure you have Jest and the necessary testing libraries installed. If you're using `create-react-app`, Jest comes pre-configured. Otherwise, you may need to install Jest and `@types/jest` for TypeScript support.

### Installing Redux-Saga Test Plan (Optional)

For more advanced testing capabilities, including integration tests that require mocking of the Redux store, consider using `redux-saga-test-plan`. It simplifies saga testing, especially for cases involving API calls and selecting from the state.

```bash
npm install --save-dev redux-saga-test-plan
# or
yarn add --dev redux-saga-test-plan
```

### Example Test Cases for `fetchQuoteDetailsSaga`

Below are example test cases for `fetchQuoteDetailsSaga`, demonstrating how to test different aspects of the saga's behavior. These examples assume the use of Jest and optionally `redux-saga-test-plan` for a more comprehensive testing approach.

```typescript
// fetchQuoteDetailsSaga.test.ts
import { runSaga } from "redux-saga";
import * as api from "./api"; // Assuming your API calls are here
import { fetchQuoteDetailsSaga } from "./sagas";
import { FETCH_QUOTE_DETAILS_SUCCESS, FETCH_QUOTE_DETAILS_FAILURE } from "./actionTypes";
import { fetchQuoteDetailsSuccess, fetchQuoteDetailsFailure } from "./actions";

// Mock API response
const mockQuotesData = {
  lqsQuotes: [{ id: "1", expirationDate: "2023-01-01" }],
  pbmQuotes: [{ id: "2", expirationDate: "2023-02-01" }],
};

// Mock for axios.get or your API call method
jest.mock("./api", () => ({
  getAllQuotes: jest.fn(),
}));

describe("fetchQuoteDetailsSaga", () => {
  it("handles successfully fetching quotes with isFetchAll=true", async () => {
    const dispatched: any[] = [];
    const mockApi = api.getAllQuotes as jest.Mock;
    mockApi.mockResolvedValue({ data: mockQuotesData });

    await runSaga(
      {
        dispatch: (action) => dispatched.push(action),
        getState: () => ({ pbmQuotes: [] }), // Mock initial state if needed
      },
      fetchQuoteDetailsSaga,
      { payload: true } // Action payload as true to simulate isFetchAll=true
    ).toPromise();

    expect(mockApi).toHaveBeenCalledWith("/getAllQuotes?isFetchAll=true");
    expect(dispatched).toContainEqual(
      fetchQuoteDetailsSuccess({
        quotes: [...mockQuotesData.lqsQuotes, ...mockQuotesData.pbmQuotes],
        pbmQuotes: mockQuotesData.pbmQuotes,
      })
    );
  });

  it("handles failure in fetching quotes", async () => {
    const error = "An error occurred";
    const dispatched: any[] = [];
    const mockApi = api.getAllQuotes as jest.Mock;
    mockApi.mockRejectedValue(new Error(error));

    await runSaga(
      {
        dispatch: (action) => dispatched.push(action),
        getState: () => ({ pbmQuotes: [] }),
      },
      fetchQuoteDetailsSaga,
      { payload: true } // Action payload
    ).toPromise();

    expect(mockApi).toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(dispatched).toContainEqual(fetchQuoteDetailsFailure(error));
  });
});
```

### Key Points:

- **Mocking API Calls**: Use `jest.mock` to mock the API module and its methods. This allows you to control the responses and simulate different scenarios (success, failure).
- **Running the Saga**: Use `runSaga` to execute the saga in a test environment. This utility allows you to provide a mocked `dispatch` and `getState` to simulate Redux store behavior.
- **Asserting Effects**: Check that the saga dispatches the expected actions with `expect(dispatched).toContainEqual(...)`. This verifies the saga's behavior based on the mocked API responses and state.

This example provides a basic structure for testing your `fetchQuoteDetailsSaga`. Depending on your application's complexity, you may need to adjust the tests, such as by providing more detailed state mocks or handling additional saga effects.
