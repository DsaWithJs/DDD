Writing test cases for the `startTokenRefresh` function involves testing both the immediate fetching of the token and the scheduling of token refreshes. Since `fetchTokenWithRetries` is an asynchronous operation and `setInterval` is used for scheduling, testing this function can be a bit complex. You will need to mock external dependencies and handle asynchronous behavior.

Here's a basic structure for your test cases using a testing framework like Jest:

### 1. Mocking Dependencies

First, you need to mock the `fetchTokenWithRetries` function and `setInterval`.

```javascript
jest.mock('path-to-fetchTokenWithRetries', () => ({
  fetchTokenWithRetries: jest.fn()
}));

jest.useFakeTimers();
```

### 2. Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Check Immediate Token Fetch

Verify that `fetchTokenWithRetries` is called immediately when `startTokenRefresh` is invoked.

```javascript
it('should immediately call fetchTokenWithRetries', async () => {
  const type = "sampleType";
  const url = "http://example.com";

  await startTokenRefresh(type, url);

  expect(fetchTokenWithRetries).toHaveBeenCalledWith(type, url);
});
```

#### Test Case 2: Check Interval Set Correctly

Verify that `fetchTokenWithRetries` is scheduled to be called at the correct interval.

```javascript
it('should schedule fetchTokenWithRetries at correct intervals', async () => {
  const type = "sampleType";
  const url = "http://example.com";

  await startTokenRefresh(type, url);
  
  // Fast-forward time
  jest.advanceTimersByTime(12 * 60 * 1000);

  expect(fetchTokenWithRetries).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
});
```

#### Test Case 3: Check Interval Calls with Correct Arguments

Verify that the scheduled calls of `fetchTokenWithRetries` use the correct arguments.

```javascript
it('should call fetchTokenWithRetries with correct arguments on interval', async () => {
  const type = "sampleType";
  const url = "http://example.com";

  await startTokenRefresh(type, url);
  
  // Fast-forward time
  jest.advanceTimersByTime(12 * 60 * 1000);

  expect(fetchTokenWithRetries).toHaveBeenCalledWith(type, url);
});
```

### 3. Cleanup

After your tests, make sure to clear any mocks or timers if necessary to avoid interference with other tests.

```javascript
afterEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();
  jest.clearAllTimers();
});
```

### Conclusion

These test cases cover the immediate execution and the scheduling of `fetchTokenWithRetries` within `startTokenRefresh`. They ensure that the function behaves as expected both at the time of invocation and over time with the scheduled interval. Remember to adapt these examples to fit the specifics of your implementation and testing environment.
