To test an Axios instance that has a request interceptor added, like the one you described, using Jest, you'll want to focus on a few key areas:

1. **Mocking Axios**: Since you're making HTTP requests with Axios, you'll want to avoid making actual requests in your tests. You can use `jest.mock()` to mock the Axios library, allowing you to control its behavior during tests.
2. **Testing the Interceptor Logic**: You'll want to ensure that the interceptor is adding the expected metadata to the config object.
3. **Verifying the Request**: Test that the Axios instance makes requests with the correct configuration and endpoint.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to write these test cases:

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Test Environment

First, ensure you have Jest installed in your project. If not, you can add it along with types for TypeScript (if you're using TypeScript) by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest
```

### Step 2: Mocking Axios

In your test file, you'll start by mocking Axios. Jest allows you to do this easily:

```typescript
// myAxiosInstance.test.ts or myAxiosInstance.test.js

jest.mock("axios", () => ({
  create: jest.fn(() => ({
    interceptors: {
      request: { use: jest.fn() },
      response: { use: jest.fn() },
    },
    get: jest.fn(),
    // Add other methods you use like post, put, delete, etc.
  })),
}));
```

### Step 3: Writing the Test Cases

Now, let's write a test case to ensure that the request interceptor adds the correct metadata to the config:

```typescript
import axios from "axios"; // Ensure you import axios to be able to mock it

describe("Axios instance with interceptors", () => {
  it("should add metadata to the config on request", async () => {
    // Assuming your axiosInstance creation logic is in a function or directly used here
    const axiosInstance = axios.create({
      /* your config here */
    });
    axiosInstance.interceptors.request.use(function (config: any) {
      config.metadata = { startTime: new Date(), endpoint: config.url };
      return config;
    });

    // Mocking the actual request method
    const mockGet = axiosInstance.get as jest.Mock;
    mockGet.mockImplementation((url) => Promise.resolve({ data: "response", config: { url } }));

    // Perform a request
    await axiosInstance.get("/test-endpoint");

    // Check if the request was made with the correct metadata
    expect(mockGet).toHaveBeenCalled();
    const callArg = mockGet.mock.calls[0][0]; // Get the config object passed to the mock
    expect(callArg).toHaveProperty("metadata");
    expect(callArg.metadata).toHaveProperty("startTime");
    expect(callArg.metadata).toHaveProperty("endpoint", "/test-endpoint");
  });
});
```

### Step 4: Running Your Tests

Make sure your `package.json` has a test script set up to run Jest, then execute your tests using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm test
```

or

```bash
yarn test
```

This basic structure gives you a starting point to expand your tests. You can add more tests to cover different HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), test response interceptors similarly, or check how your Axios instance handles errors, among other scenarios.
