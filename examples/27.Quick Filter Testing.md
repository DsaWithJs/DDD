To achieve 100% code coverage for the "QuickFilter" component using Jest and `@testing-library/react`, you'll want to test various aspects of the component:

1. **Rendering**: Verify that the component renders correctly.
2. **Functionality**: Ensure that selecting different options correctly filters the data.
3. **Default Filter Application**: Check that the default filter is applied on initial render.
4. **Dynamic Filter Options**: Test the component with different sets of `enableFilter` props to ensure it only shows the specified options.

Below are example tests that cover these aspects. Before running these tests, ensure you have Jest and `@testing-library/react` set up in your project.

### Setup for Testing

First, ensure your project is set up for Jest and React Testing Library. You may need to install them if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

You might also need to configure Jest in your `package.json` or through a Jest config file to work with TypeScript and React. This typically involves setting up `ts-jest` and specifying the test environment:

```json
"jest": {
  "preset": "ts-jest",
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom",
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect"]
}
```

### Example Tests for "QuickFilter"

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { render, fireEvent, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import QuickFilter from "./QuickFilter"; // Adjust the import path as necessary

// Mock data for testing
const mockData = [
  { status: "open", quote: "Quote 1" },
  { status: "closed", quote: "Quote 2" },
  { status: "active", quote: "Quote 3" },
];

describe("QuickFilter Component", () => {
  test("renders with default filter applied", () => {
    const handleFilteredDataChange = jest.fn();
    render(<QuickFilter data={mockData} onFilteredDataChange={handleFilteredDataChange} defaultFilter="open" enableFilter={["open", "closed", "active"]} />);

    // Default filter is 'open', so it should filter out accordingly
    expect(handleFilteredDataChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith([mockData[0]]);
  });

  test("updates data on filter change", () => {
    const handleFilteredDataChange = jest.fn();
    render(<QuickFilter data={mockData} onFilteredDataChange={handleFilteredDataChange} defaultFilter="open" enableFilter={["open", "closed"]} />);

    // Change the filter to 'closed'
    fireEvent.change(screen.getByRole("combobox"), { target: { value: "closed" } });
    expect(handleFilteredDataChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith([mockData[1]]);
  });

  test("only shows enabled filters", () => {
    render(
      <QuickFilter
        data={mockData}
        onFilteredDataChange={() => {}}
        defaultFilter="open"
        enableFilter={["open", "closed"]} // 'active' is intentionally left out
      />
    );

    const options = screen.getAllByRole("option");
    expect(options.length).toBe(2); // Should only have 'open' and 'closed'
    expect(screen.queryByText("Active")).toBeNull();
  });
});
```

### Explanation

- **Rendering Test**: Verifies that the component renders and applies the default filter correctly.
- **Functionality Test**: Ensures that changing the filter updates the displayed data as expected.
- **Dynamic Filter Options Test**: Confirms that only the specified filters in `enableFilter` are shown.

### Running Tests

To run your tests, you can typically use the command:

```bash
npm test
```

Or if you have a specific script set up in your `package.json`, use that.

### Note

- Adjust the import path for `QuickFilter` according to your project structure.
- These tests assume `QuickFilter` calls `onFilteredDataChange` with the filtered data upon rendering and after selecting a new filter. If the actual implementation differs, you might need to adjust the tests accordingly.
- You may need to mock or stub out additional functionality depending on how `QuickFilter` interacts with other parts of your application or if it uses external data fetching.

The provided tests cover several critical aspects of the `QuickFilter` component's functionality, ensuring it behaves as expected under various scenarios. However, achieving 100% code coverage often involves testing additional edge cases and implementation details. Here are some additional scenarios and considerations that might be necessary to truly achieve full coverage:

1. **Edge Cases**:

   - What happens if `enableFilter` includes a filter that doesn't match any `filterFunction`?
   - Behavior when `defaultFilter` is set to a value not included in `enableFilter`.
   - Handling an empty `data` array.

2. **Prop Changes**:

   - Testing the component's response to prop changes after the initial render, such as changing the `defaultFilter` or `enableFilter` props. This can be achieved by using the `rerender` method from `@testing-library/react`.

3. **Invalid Props**:

   - Providing invalid types or unexpected values to props (e.g., passing a non-existent `defaultFilter` value) and ensuring the component handles these gracefully.

4. **Accessibility and Semantic Markup**:
   - Verifying that the component is accessible, including roles, labels, and keyboard navigation.

### Example of Testing Prop Changes

```jsx
test("responds to prop changes correctly", () => {
  const handleFilteredDataChange = jest.fn();
  const { rerender } = render(<QuickFilter data={mockData} onFilteredDataChange={handleFilteredDataChange} defaultFilter="open" enableFilter={["open", "closed"]} />);

  // Initial assertion for default filter
  expect(handleFilteredDataChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith([mockData[0]]);

  // Rerender with new props
  rerender(<QuickFilter data={mockData} onFilteredDataChange={handleFilteredDataChange} defaultFilter="closed" enableFilter={["open", "closed", "active"]} />);

  // Assertion for updated props
  expect(handleFilteredDataChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith([mockData[1]]);
});
```

### Additional Considerations for Full Coverage

- **Component Cleanup**: If your component has side effects (e.g., using `useEffect` for data fetching or subscriptions), ensure you test the cleanup functionality to prevent memory leaks.
- **Mocking External Interactions**: If the component interacts with browser APIs (e.g., fetching data from an API, interacting with local storage), you might need to mock these interactions.
- **Performance Implications**: While not directly related to code coverage, it's beneficial to consider the performance of your component under test, especially if it's intended to handle large datasets.

Achieving 100% code coverage is an admirable goal, but it's also important to focus on the quality and relevance of your tests. Ensuring that your tests meaningfully validate your component's behavior is often more valuable than meeting a specific coverage metric. Remember, the primary goal of testing is to ensure your application works as expected for your users, not just to hit coverage targets.

To further enhance the test coverage of the `QuickFilter` component, we will add two more test cases:

1. **Disabling "QuickFilter"**: Since the functionality to disable the `QuickFilter` directly isn't built into the component, but rather controlled by the parent (like not rendering it based on some condition), this scenario would typically involve testing the parent component's ability to render or not render `QuickFilter` based on some state. However, we can simulate a scenario where the `QuickFilter` would effectively be "disabled" by passing an empty array for `enableFilter`, meaning no filters can be selected.

2. **No `defaultFilter` and `enableFilter` Provided**: Test the component's behavior when neither `defaultFilter` nor `enableFilter` props are provided. This will test the component's fallback or default behavior.

### Test Case for Effectively Disabling "QuickFilter"

```jsx
test("behaves correctly when enableFilter is empty (effectively disabled)", () => {
  const handleFilteredDataChange = jest.fn();
  render(
    <QuickFilter
      data={mockData}
      onFilteredDataChange={handleFilteredDataChange}
      defaultFilter="open"
      enableFilter={[]} // Empty array simulates no available filters
    />
  );

  // Expect no filter options to be available, hence no filter function called
  const options = screen.queryAllByRole("option");
  expect(options.length).toBe(0); // No options should be rendered
  expect(handleFilteredDataChange).not.toHaveBeenCalled(); // No filter change should be triggered
});
```

### Test Case for No `defaultFilter` and `enableFilter` Provided

```jsx
test("renders correctly without defaultFilter and enableFilter props", () => {
  const handleFilteredDataChange = jest.fn();
  render(
    <QuickFilter
      data={mockData}
      onFilteredDataChange={handleFilteredDataChange}
      // No defaultFilter or enableFilter provided
    />
  );

  // Expect the component to still render with all options by default
  const options = screen.getAllByRole("option");
  expect(options.length).toBe(3); // Should render all filter options

  // Assume the first filter is applied by default if no defaultFilter is provided
  expect(handleFilteredDataChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith([mockData[0]]);
});
```

### Explanation

1. **Effectively Disabling "QuickFilter"**: By providing an empty array to `enableFilter`, we simulate a scenario where no filters are available for selection. This test checks that the component does not render any filter options and does not attempt to apply a non-existent filter.

2. **No `defaultFilter` and `enableFilter`**: This test verifies that the component can handle cases where no `defaultFilter` or `enableFilter` props are provided. The expected behavior is that all possible filters are rendered, and if the logic is implemented to select the first available filter as default in absence of `defaultFilter`, it checks that as well.

These test cases help ensure the `QuickFilter` component is robust and behaves predictably even in edge cases or less common usage scenarios.
