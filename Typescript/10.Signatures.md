## Signatures

```txt
In TypeScript, function signatures describe the types of parameters and the return type of a function. This includes the parameter names, their types, and the return type.
```

Example

```ts
type MathOperation = (a: number, b: number) => number;

const add: MathOperation = (a, b) => a + b;
const subtract: MathOperation = (a, b) => a - b;
```

Here, MathOperation is a type representing a function that takes two numbers and returns a number. Both add and subtract are functions adhering to this signature.
