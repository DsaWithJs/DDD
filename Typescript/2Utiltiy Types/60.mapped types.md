## Mapped Types

```txt
Mapped Types: Mapped types allow you to create new types based on the properties of an existing type.

```

You can transform, add, or remove properties using mapped types.

 The keyof and in operators are often used in mapped types.

```txt
Mapped Types allow you to create new types by transforming the properties of an existing type.

The keyof and in operators are often used in mapped types.

```

Example

```ts
type Flags = {
  option1: boolean;
  option2: boolean;
};

type NullableFlags = {
  [K in keyof Flags]: boolean | null;
};

// Result: { option1: boolean | null, option2: boolean | null }
```

```ts
type NewType<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]: SomeTransformation;
};

type OptionalProps<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]?: T[P];
};

This OptionalPropstype makes all properties of T optional by using the (?) property.
```

```txt
A mapped type iterates over the properties of an existing type and applies transformations to create a new type. A common use case is to create a read-only version of a type.
```

```ts
type Readonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};

interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
type ReadonlyPoint = Readonly<Point>;
```
