Conditional types in TypeScript are a powerful feature used for creating types that depend on conditions. They are akin to JavaScript's ternary operator but applied at the type level. Here are some real-world use cases where conditional types are particularly useful:

### 1. Type Filtering

Conditional types can be used to filter types within a union. This is particularly useful when you want to create a new type by excluding certain types from a union.

Example:

```typescript
type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;
```

This built-in utility type in TypeScript excludes `null` and `undefined` from a type `T`.

### 2. Type Transformation

They can be used to transform types based on certain conditions. This is commonly seen in utility types.

Example:

```typescript
type ReadOnly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};
```

This type makes all properties of `T` read-only if `T` is an object type.

### 3. Overloading Return Types Based on Arguments

Conditional types allow function return types to depend on the arguments.

Example:

```typescript
function fetchData<T extends boolean>(flag: T): T extends true ? Data : void {
  // Implementation...
}
```

Here, the return type changes based on a boolean flag.

### 4. Type Inference in Generic Types

They are useful for inferring types within other types, especially within generic functions.

Example:

```typescript
type ElementType<T> = T extends (infer U)[] ? U : T;
```

This utility type extracts the element type from an array type.

### 5. API Response Handling

In cases where an API might return different shapes of data based on inputs or endpoints, conditional types can be used to type these responses accurately.

Example:

```typescript
type ApiResponse<T> = T extends "user" ? User : T extends "product" ? Product : Error;
```

### 6. Framework and Library Development

For developers working on frameworks and libraries, conditional types offer a way to create more flexible and reusable types that adapt based on user input.

Example:
In a UI component library, a component might change its props type based on a certain prop value.

### 7. Handling State in UI Development

In frontend development, especially with frameworks like React, conditional types can be used to type different states of a component (like loading, success, error).

Example:

```typescript
type State<T> = {
  data?: T;
  loading: boolean;
  error?: Error;
};
```

The `State` type can be adapted based on the data type `T`.

### Conclusion

Conditional types are a versatile tool in TypeScript, particularly valuable for creating robust, flexible, and reusable types. They shine in scenarios requiring type manipulation based on conditions, making them indispensable in complex TypeScript applications.
