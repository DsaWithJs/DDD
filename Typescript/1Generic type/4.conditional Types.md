## Generic Conditional Types

```txt
Conditional types shine more with generics, generics in Typescript are similar to parameters in functions. They allow us to define a type or a set of types that can be used in multiple places in our code. This helps us write more reusable and generic code. However, oftentimes, we might want to create a new and flexible type based on a Generic, For example, let’s look at this snippet.
```

```ts
type isNumber<T> = T extends number ? true : false.
```

```txt
The isNumber type takes a generic parameter T and checks whether T extends the number type. If it does, the type evaluates to true; otherwise, it evaluates to false. For example, isNumber<32> would evaluate to true, while isNumber<"hello"> would evaluate to false.
```

```txt
Let’s look at a typical typescript example Flatten<T> but we call it UnArray<T>,
```

```ts
type UnArray<T> = T extends any[] ? T[number] : T;
type Users = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  city: string;
}[];
type User = UnArray<Users>;
/**  {
	name: string,
	age: number,
	city: string
} */
type Str = UnArray<string>; // string
```
