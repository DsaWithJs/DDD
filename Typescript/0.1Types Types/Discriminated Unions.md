## Discriminated Unions

Discriminated Unions are a pattern where each type in a union has a common property with literal types which TypeScript can use to discriminate between them.

```ts
type Circle = {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
};

type Square = {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
};

type Shape = Circle | Square;

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case "square":
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
  }
}
```
