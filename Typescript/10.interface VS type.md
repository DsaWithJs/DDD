```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  greet(): void;
}

class Student implements Person {
  name: string = "";
  age: number = 0;
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
}
```

```ts
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

type Result = "success" | "error";

type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

type Admin = User & {
  role: "admin";
};

# Use Interfaces when:

```txt
Describing the shape of objects.
Enforcing contracts for classes.
Used to create objects based on a blueprint (class).
Encapsulates data (properties) and behaviour (methods) into a single unit.
Supports concepts like inheritance and encapsulation.
```

## Key Characteristics

```txt
Can include both property declarations and method implementations.
Supports constructors for initializing objects.
Can extend other classes using the extends keyword.
Enables the use of access modifiers (public, private, protected) for controlling visibility.
```

# Use Types when:

```txt
Creating reusable type aliases.
Combining or modifying existing types.
Used to create aliases for types.
Primarily used for creating complex type combinations or providing descriptive names for existing types.
```

## Key Characteristics

```txt
Does not create new types but creates an alias for an existing type.
Can be used for primitive types, union types, intersection types, and more.
Supports generics for creating reusable type patterns.

```
