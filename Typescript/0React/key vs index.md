In TypeScript, the two interfaces you provided are essentially identical in terms of functionality. They both define a type for an object where the keys are strings and the values are strings. The difference lies only in the naming of the index signature parameter (`index` vs. `key`), which is purely a matter of preference and does not affect the behavior of the code.

### Comparison

1. **Using `index` as the index signature parameter:**

   ```typescript
   interface NumberDictionary {
     [index: string]: string;
   }
   ```

   Here, `index` is used as the name for the index signature parameter. It's just a name and has no impact on how the type works. It could be any valid identifier.

2. **Using `key` as the index signature parameter:**

   ```typescript
   interface NumberDictionary {
     [key: string]: string;
   }
   ```

   Similarly, `key` is another valid identifier, and it functions exactly the same as the previous example.

### Explanation

- **Index Signature**: The `[key: string]: string` (or `[index: string]: string`) syntax defines an index signature for the interface. It indicates that any property of the object can be accessed with a string key, and the value associated with that key will be a string.

- **Parameter Name**: The name `index` or `key` is arbitrary and is used to refer to the key in the context of defining the type. You could use any other valid identifier (e.g., `prop`, `id`, `name`, etc.), and the type definition would still work the same way.

### Example Usage

Regardless of whether you use `index` or `key`, the object that adheres to this interface will behave the same:

```typescript
interface NumberDictionary {
  [index: string]: string;
}

interface AnotherDictionary {
  [key: string]: string;
}

const myDict: NumberDictionary = {
  apples: "red",
  bananas: "yellow"
};

const anotherDict: AnotherDictionary = {
  apples: "red",
  bananas: "yellow"
};
```

In both `myDict` and `anotherDict`, the objects allow any string as a key and enforce that the corresponding value is a string.

### Conclusion

The difference between `index` and `key` in your examples is purely semantic. It does not affect the interface's functionality or how TypeScript interprets the object structure. The choice of parameter name in an index signature is up to the developer and should be based on clarity and convention within your codebase.
