```ts
const sampleAPICall = async () => {
  return new Promise<{ name: string }>((resolve, reject) => {
    // You might have some logic here. For now, it immediately resolves.
    resolve({ name: "John Doe" });
  });
};
```

In the `sampleAPICall` function you've provided, `<{ name: string }>` is a TypeScript type annotation that specifies the type of value that the `Promise` is expected to resolve to. This is a way of defining the shape of the data that the `Promise` will return when it is fulfilled.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

- **`Promise<{ name: string }>`**: This syntax declares that the function returns a `Promise`.
- **`<{ name: string }>`**: This part is a TypeScript generic type parameter for the `Promise`. It indicates that the promise, when resolved, will yield an object with a single property `name` of type `string`.

The purpose of specifying `<{ name: string }>` in the `Promise` is to provide type safety. This ensures that:

1. **Inside the Promise**: Any code that resolves this promise must provide an object that matches the structure `{ name: string }`. This prevents accidental resolution with the wrong type of data.
2. **Outside the Promise**: When you consume this promise (i.e., when you call `sampleAPICall` and handle its result), TypeScript knows that the resolved value will be of the type `{ name: string }`. This allows for proper type checking and autocompletion in TypeScript-aware editors.

For instance, if you were to use this function elsewhere in your code, TypeScript would be able to infer that the result of the promise is an object with a `name` property of type `string`:

```typescript
sampleAPICall().then((result) => {
  console.log(result.name); // TypeScript knows that `result` is of type { name: string }
});
```

This makes your code more predictable and less prone to runtime errors, a key advantage of using TypeScript.
