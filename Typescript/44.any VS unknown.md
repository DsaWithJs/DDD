## Understanding any

```txt
The any type is the most flexible within TypeScript. It essentially disables the type-checking benefits provided by TypeScript,
allowing variables to hold any value without throwing compilation errors.

While it offers utmost flexibility, it sacrifices type safety, potentially leading to runtime errors.

```

```ts
let variable: any;

variable = 10; // Allowed
variable = "Hello"; // Allowed
variable = { key: "value" }; // Allowed

// No compilation errors
const length = variable.length; // No type checking
```

## Exploring unknown:

```txt

In contrast, unknown represents a type-safe counterpart to any. It's a type-safe placeholder that ensures stricter type handling. Variables of type unknown require explicit type assertion or narrowing before performing operations on them.
```

```ts
let userInput: unknown;

userInput = 10; // Allowed
userInput = "Hello"; // Allowed
userInput = { key: "value" }; // Allowed

// Type assertion or type narrowing is necessary
const length = (userInput as string).length; // Type assertion needed
```

## Key Differences:

### Type Safety:

```txt
any offers maximum flexibility but sacrifices type safety.
unknown prioritizes type safety by enforcing explicit type checks.
```

### Implicit vs Explicit Handling:

```txt
With any, TypeScript assumes minimal responsibility for type checking.
unknown obligates developers to explicitly handle types before operations.
```

## Best Practices:

```txt
Prefer unknown over any: unknown provides a safer alternative when dealing with uncertain types.
Limit Usage of any: Reserve any for scenarios where type information is genuinely ambiguous or when interoperating with JavaScript libraries lacking type definitions.
```

When to Use Types ðŸ’¡
1. When you need to create a union or intersection of multiple types.
2. When you want to create an alias for a complex type.
3. When you are dealing with scenarios that require reusing types across the project.
```

```txt
When to Use InterfacesðŸ’¡
1. When you want to specify the structure that an object must adhere to.
2. When you need to extend an object shape or class to ensure it adheres to a contract.
3. When you are defining the shape of an object that will be used by multiple classes or functions.
