T: This is a standard generic placeholder used to represent a type. Itâ€™s pervasive and frequently employed when creating classes or functions intended to work seamlessly with various types.
U, V, W: Similar to T, these placeholders are used when multiple type parameters are required in a class or function, providing a clear and systematic way to handle various types.
K, V: When dealing with key-value pairs, such as in objects or dictionaries, K is commonly used to denote the key type, while V is used for the value type.
E: Specifically used for elements, E is a common choice when working with collections like arrays or lists.
R: Reserved for representing the return type of a function, R is employed to clearly indicate the type expected as the result.
A, B, C: These generic type parameters are versatile placeholders suitable for general-purpose use, particularly when dealing with multiple placeholders.
P, Q: Additional placeholders designed for scenarios where more than three type parameters are necessary, contributing to a structured and readable code.
T[]: When working with generic array types, the convention is to use T to represent the type of elements contained within the array. This provides a straightforward and recognizable way to handle arrays with varying element types.

```tsx
 interface ContainerProps<T> {
    data: T;
  }

  const Container = <T>({ data }: ContainerProps<T>) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Data: {data}</p>
      </div>
    );
  };
  // Example usage
  const stringContainer = <Container data="Hello, Generics!" />;
  const numberContainer = <Container data={42} />;
```
