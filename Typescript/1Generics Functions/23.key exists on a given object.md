In TypeScript, you can use the **keyof** operator and the **in** operator to check if a property with a specific key exists on a given object, even if the object is of a generic type.

```ts
function hasOwnProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): obj is { [P in K]: T[P] } {
  return obj.hasOwnProperty(key);
}
```

```txt
In this example, the function hasOwnProperty takes an object of type T and a key of type K, which extends keyof T. This means that K must be a valid key for an object of type T. The function then checks if the object has the property with the given key using the hasOwnProperty method, and returns a boolean indicating whether the property exists or not.
```

```txt
The return type obj is { [P in K]: T[P] } indicate that the key exists. You can use it like this:
```

```ts
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const result = hasOwnProperty(obj, "a"); // result is true
```

This way, the type of the key is inferred dynamically based on the object passed to the function and you can check if the object has a specific key.

And similarly you can check if an object has a certain method:

```ts
function hasMethod<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): obj is { [P in K]: T[P] & (() => any) } {
  return typeof obj[key] === "function";
}
```

In this example, the function hasMethod takes an object of type T and a key of type K, which extends keyof T. This means that K must be a valid key for an object of type T. The function then checks if the object has the method with the given key using the typeof operator, and returns a boolean indicating whether the method exists or not. The return type obj is { [P in K]: T[P] & (() => any) } indicate that the key exists and is a function. You can use the hasMethod function in the following way:

```ts
const myObject = {
  age: 25,
  printAge: () => console.log(this.age),
};
console.log(hasMethod(myObject, "printAge")); // true
console.log(hasMethod(myObject, "age")); // false
```

In this example, you are passing an object myObject and two keys printAge and age to the hasMethod function. The first call to the function returns true because the myObject object has a method with the key printAge. The second call to the function returns false because the myObject object does not have a method with the key age.
