Yes, we are there! This is what you have been waiting for.

Generics are the fundamental blocks of TypeScript that let you build reusable components that can also be strongly typed. Generics let you define functions/data structures that can take type inputs after they have been defined.

To understand what Generics are and why we need them, we’ll write a utility function that splits an array into batches of size n and returns an array of arrays.

We’ll start by adding a strict definition to this function.
```

```ts
function getPaginatedArray(arr: number[], batchSize: number = 3) {
  const batches: number[][] = [];

  const numBatches = Math.ceil(arr.length / batchSize);
  for (let i = 0; i < numBatches; i++) {
    const startInd = i * batchSize;
    const endInd = Math.min(i * batchSize + batchSize, arr.length);
    const batch = arr.slice(startInd, endInd);

    batches.push(batch);
  }

  return batches;
}

const paginatedArray = getPaginatedArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 2);
// paginatedArray: number[][] = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7]]
```

There's a problem with this code. The pagination logic written in this function is valid for all arrays regardless of the data type of the individual elements. So, how do we get this to work with arrays of any type?

A crutch that developers fall on way too often is using any whenever they are trying to write a function that accepts arguments of multiple types.
```

```ts
function getPaginatedArray(arr: any[], batchSize: number = 3) {
  const batches: any[][] = [];
  // Pagination Logic
}

const paginatedArray = getPaginatedArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 2);
// paginatedArray: any[][] = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7]]
```

```txt
This works, but the problem with any is that anytime you use it, TypeScript suspends all type-checking anywhere a variable of type any is used, which really isn’t what we want. A better approach may be using unknown instead.

When a variable is of type unknown, you can’t really interact with it in any meaningful way if you don’t ascertain the type of the variable using run-time checks.
```

```ts
function getPaginatedArray(arr: unknown[], batchSize: number = 3) {
  const batches: unknown[][] = [];
  // Pagination Logic
}

const paginatedArray = getPaginatedArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 2);
// paginatedArray: unknown[][] = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7]]

// You can't do this
let roundedOff = paginatedArray[0][1].toFixed(2);
// You will get an error stating: "Object is of type 'unknown'"

//To interact with the elements of the array as 'number', you need to prove to
//the compiler using run time checks that paginatedArray indeed is of type
//number[][]

if (paginatedArray.every((elem): elem is number[] => elem.every((subelem) => typeof subelem === "number"))) {
  let roundedOff = paginatedArray[0][1].toFixed(2);
}
```

## Generics are like function arguments, but instead of values, they accept types

```js
function getPaginatedArray<T>(arr: T[], batchSize: number = 3) {
  const batches: T[][] = [];
  // Pagination Logic
}

//Now you can pass the type of the array at the point of function invocation
//just like you do for the input array
const paginatedArray = getPaginatedArray < number > ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 2);
//paginatedArray: number[][]

//We explicitly supplied a generic argument in the line above. This lets
//the compiler know what the return type of the function is.
//But we don't really need to. As the compiler knows that T is equal to the
//type of *arr*, it can infer the generic value from the type of argument
//that it's associated with. Which means that

const paginatedArray = getPaginatedArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 2);
//paginatedArray: number[][]

//both of the statements get you the same result
```

What if I also want to return the starting index and ending index with the batch? Something like this
```

```ts
type PaginatedArray = {
  startingIndex: number;
  endingIndex: number;
  batch: number[];
};
```

```txt
Well, the good news is that you can create generic types to handle such a case. So we can rewrite PaginatedArray as
```

```ts
type PaginatedArray<T> = {
  startingIndex: number;
  endingIndex: number;
  batch: T[];
};
```

```ts
function getPaginatedArray<T>(arr: T[], batchSize: number = 3): PaginatedArray<T>[] {
  const batches: PaginatedArray<T>[] = [];

  const numBatches = Math.ceil(arr.length / batchSize);
  for (let i = 0; i < numBatches; i++) {
    const startInd = i * batchSize;
    const endInd = Math.min(i * batchSize + batchSize, arr.length);
    const batch = arr.slice(startInd, endInd);

    batches.push({
      startingIndex: startInd,
      endingIndex: endInd,
      batch,
    });
  }

  return batches;
}

const paginatedArray = getPaginatedArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 2);
/**
paginatedArray: {
  startingIndex: number;
  endingIndex: number;
  batch: number[]
}[] = 
[
  {"startingIndex":0,"endingIndex":2,"batch":[1,2]},
  {"startingIndex":2,"endingIndex":4,"batch":[3,4]},
  {"startingIndex":4,"endingIndex":6,"batch":[5,6]},
  {"startingIndex":6,"endingIndex":7,"batch":[7]}
]
*/
```

Before we move on to writing more complicated generics, I want to introduce the concept of a Default Generic Argument. These are exactly the same as default parameters in function definitions. These are values you assign a generic which are used when the user doesn’t supply a generic argument. Suppose you want the batch property of the PaginatedArray type to be any[] if it’s not explicitly supplied, then we can use a default generic as demonstrated in the code snippet below
```

```ts
type PaginatedArray<T = any> = {
  startingIndex: number;
  endingIndex: number;
  batch: T[];
};
```

Writing functions with a single generic argument is easy, but can we take multiple generic arguments? Of course, we can. Let’s write our own version of the Python zip function in typescript that takes two generic arguments.
```

```ts
function Zip<T, S>(arr1: T[], arr2: S[]) {
  const zippedArr: [T, S][] = [];

  const minLength = Math.min(arr1.length, arr2.length);

  arr1 = arr1.slice(0, minLength);
  arr2 = arr2.slice(0, minLength);

  for (let i = 0; i < minLength; i++) {
    zippedArr.push([arr1[i], arr2[i]]);
  }

  return zippedArr;
}

//You can call the function without specifying explicit generic arguments
//and the compiler will just infer it from the arguments used in the
//function invocation

const zippedArray = Zip([1, 2, 3], ["New York", "London", "Tokyo"]);
/**
  zippedArray: [number,string][] = [[1,"New York"],[2,"London"],[3,"Tokyo"]]
*/
```

## Strongly Typed Burger Factory

```ts
/**
  First we define all the types we need to make a burger
*/
type Bread = "Slider" | "Brioche Buns" | "Bagette";
type PattyType = "Chicken" | "Mutton" | "Soyabean";
type Topping = "Bacon" | "Chillies" | "Avacado" | "Lettuce";

declare const burgerBuilder: BurgerBuilder;

/**
  We use a default generic (Burger) here to denote the initial state
  of the burger, which is empty.
*/
type BurgerBuilder<Burger = {}> = {
  /**
      This method retuns a BurgerBuilder object on which we can
      do method chaining to add ingredients to our burger
     */
  createBurgerBuilder(): BurgerBuilder<Burger>;
  /**
      This method returns a BurgerBuilder where the components of this burger
      are every ingredient it had before, plus a bread. And since this also
      returns a burger builder, you can chain other methods and add
      more ingredients
    */
  addBread(bread: Bread): BurgerBuilder<Burger & { bread: Bread }>;
  addPatty(patty: PattyType): BurgerBuilder<Burger & { patty: PattyType }>;
  addLettuceLeaves(lettuceLeaves: number): BurgerBuilder<Burger & { lettuceLeaves: number }>;
  addCheeseSlice(numCheeseSlice: number): BurgerBuilder<Burger & { numCheeseSlice: number }>;
  addTopping(topping: Topping): BurgerBuilder<Burger & { topping: Topping }>;
  /**
      The build method returns the burger that we have built and the type 
      of Burger it returns completely depends on the methods that were
      chained before calling build
    */
  build(): Burger;
};
```
