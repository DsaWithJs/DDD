Generics may be used in TypeScript to offer a type to a function. You can use generics to designate a placeholder type that will be sent to the function when it is invoked.

Here is the function outline
```

```ts
function CustomTable<TableProps>({ tableData }: { tableData: TableProps[] }) {}
```

```txt
The CustomTable function in the above example is defined using a generic type argument TableProps>. This enables the function to accept any type of argument, which is represented by the placeholder TableProps.

The syntax is as follows:
```

```ts
function functionName<interfaceForAProp>(propsOfThisFunction: interfaceForPropsOfThisFunction) {}
```

```txt
By utilising <TableProps>, the CustomTable function becomes a generic function that may take multiple types for the TableProps parameter. This gives you more freedom when using the function with different data formats and property types.

The interface of props provided alongside the props in the function signature serves two purposes:

1)It offers type verification as well as documentation: You may describe the anticipated form and types of props that should be supplied to the function by creating an interface for the function props. This aids with the detection of any mistakes during compilation and gives an explicit explanation of how the function should be used.

2)It supports type inference and autocompletes: TypeScript can infer the types of the props supplied to the function based on the interface specification when the interface is defined. When utilising the function, this provides type checking, autocompletion, and improved IDE support.

In summary, generics and interfaces are combined in this code to produce a reusable function (CustomTable) that can deal with many types of (TableProps) while offering type safety, documentation, and a better development experience via type inference and auto-completion.
