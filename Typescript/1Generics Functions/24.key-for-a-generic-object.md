In TypeScript, you can use a combination of the **keyof** operator and a type parameter to create a generic function that can work with properties of a given type that have dynamic keys. Here's an example:

```ts
function getProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {
  return obj[key];
}
```

In this example, the function getProperty takes an object of type T and a key of type K, which extends keyof T. This means that K must be a valid key for an object of type T. The function then returns the value of the property on the object with the given key. You can use it like this:

```ts
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const value = getProperty(obj, "a"); // value is 1
```

This way, the type of the key is inferred dynamically based on the object passed to the function.
