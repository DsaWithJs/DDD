## What are Generics?

**Generics provide you with a way of using Types without having to specify one.** This provides a new level of flexibility over your Functions, Classes, and even Interface definitions.

**Generics provide arguments to types.**

```ts
function get(obj, prop) {
  if (!obj[prop]) return null;
  return obj[prop];
}
```

I could’ve used hasOwnProperty or something like that, but you get the point, you need to perform a basic structural check to make sure you control the use case in which the property you’re trying to access does not belong to the object. Now, let’s move this into the type-safety land of TypeScript and see how Generics can help us:

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  city: string;
};

function getPersonProp<K extends keyof Person>(p: Person, key: K): any {
  return p[key];
}
```

Now, notice how I’m using the Generics notation: I’m not only declaring a generic type K, but I’m also saying it extends the type of a key of Person. This is amazing! You can declaratively state you’re either going to pass a value that matches the strings name , age or city.

you can make this more exciting by re-defining this function like this:

```ts
function get<T, K extends keyof T>(p: T, key: K): any {
  return p[key];
}

let myP: Person = {
  name: "Fernando",
  age: 37,
  city: "Madrid",
};

console.log(get(myP, "address"));
console.log(get(myP, "name"));
```

```ts
function getMaxNumChildren<T>(data: T[], childKey: keyof T) {
  return data.reduce((max: number, parent: T) => {
    return max > parent[childKey].length ? max : parent[childKey].length;
  }, 0);
}
```
