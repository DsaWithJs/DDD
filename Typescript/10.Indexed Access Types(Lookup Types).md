## Indexed Access Types

```txt
Indexed Access Types, sometimes called Lookup Types, allow you to look up the type of a property in an object based on its key. The syntax uses square brackets with the key type inside.
```

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  city: string;
};

type AgeType = Person["age"]; // number
```

In this example, Person['age'] retrieves the type of the 'age' property from the Person type.

## Indexed Access Types

```txt
Indexed Access Types (also known as Lookup Types) allow us to look up the type of a property on another type.
This is done by writing T[K], where T is some type and K is a type that can be used as an index for T.
```

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Age = Person["age"]; // Age is of type number
```
