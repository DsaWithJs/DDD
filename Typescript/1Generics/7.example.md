## Distributive Conditional Types

```txt
Distributive conditional types in TypeScript are a feature that allows conditional types to be applied to each member of a union type. This means that if we have a type that is a union of several types, we can apply a conditional type to each individual type in the union.

To better understand this concept, let’s consider an example where we have a union type Animal that can represent either a Dog or a Cat. We want to create a conditional type Sound that takes an Animal type and returns the appropriate sound based on the type of animal.
```

```ts
type Dog = {
  type: "dog";
};

type Cat = {
  type: "cat";
};

type Sound<T> = T extends Dog ? "Bark" : T extends Cat ? "Meow" : never;

type DogSound = Sound<Dog>; // 'Bark'
type CatSound = Sound<Cat>; // 'Meow'

type AnimalUnion = Dog | Cat;

type AnimalSound = Sound<AnimalUnion>; // 'Bark' | 'Meow'

This means that the distributive conditional type applies the condition to each member of the union and gives us the union of the results.
```

## Combining Conditional Types with Mapped Types

```ts
type AllowNull<T, K extends keyof T> = {
  [P in keyof T]: P extends K ? T[P] | null : T[P];
};

interface Car {
  id: number;
  brand: string;
  model: string;
  manufacturingYear: number;
}

type OptionalCar = AllowNull<Car, "brand" | "model">;

{
  id: number;
  brand: string | null;
  model: string | null;
  manufacturingYear: number;
}
```

## Conditional Types with keyof operator and indexed access types

```ts
interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

type KeysOfType<T, U> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends U ? K : never;
}[keyof T];

type StringKeys = KeysOfType<Product, string>; // Results in "name" | "description"
type NumberKeys = KeysOfType<Product, number>; // Results in "id" | "price"

1)The KeysOfType type takes two type parameters, T and U. T represents the object type we’re working with, and U represents the desired value type we want to filter by.
2)Within the type definition, we use a mapped type to iterate through each key in the object type T. For each key K, we check whether the corresponding property’s value extends (is assignable to) the type U. If it does, we include that key K in the resulting type; otherwise, we include never.
3)The mapped type produces a union of the keys that match the desired value type U. We use [keyof T] to further access and unionize these keys.
