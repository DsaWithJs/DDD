## object literal

```txt
In addition to the primitive types, TypeScript allows complex types (like objects and functions) to be easily defined and used in type constraints. Just as object literals are at the root of most object definitions in JavaScript, the object type literal is at the root of most object type definitions in TypeScript. In its most basic form, it looks very similar to a normal JavaScript object literal:
```

```ts
let point: {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

// OK, properties match
point = { x: 0, y: 0 };
// Error, x property type is wrong
point = { x: "zero", y: 0 };
// Error, missing required property y
point = { x: 0 };
// Error, object literal may only specify known properties
point = { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };
const otherPoint = { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };
// OK, extra properties not relevant for non-literal assignment
point = otherPoint;
```

## index signature

```txt
Objects that are intended to be used as hash maps or ordered lists can be given an index signature, which enables arbitrary keys to be defined on an object:
```

```ts
interface HashMapOfPoints {
  [key: string]: Point;
}
```
