1)Type aliases can be used to define any type, including primitive types, object types, union types, and intersection types, whereas interfaces can only be used to define object types.

2)Interfaces can be extended, while type canâ€™t. Type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.
```

```ts
// Interface
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Bear extends Animal {
  honey: boolean;
}

// Type can extended via intersection thatis not good way
type Animal = {
  name: string;
};

type Bear = Animal & {
  honey: boolean;
};
```

3. Type aliases can be used to create aliases for existing types, whereas interfaces cannot.

4. A type cannot be changed after being created while interface can be changed
```

```ts
interface Window {
  title: string;
}

interface Window {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}
// Now window interface have both properties
```
