Let’s say we have a Button that is either primary or secondary .

```ts
type ButtonVariant = "primary" | "secondary";

type ButtonProps = React.ComponentProps<"button"> & {
  variant: ButtonVariant;
};

export const Button = ({ children, variant, ...rest }: ButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <button {...rest}>
      {variant}
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

We would use that component like this:

```ts
<Button variant="primary">I'm primary</Button>;
<Button variant="secondary">I'm secondary</Button>;
```

And we should get type safety with the following refusing to compile:

```ts
<Button variant="tertiary">I'm not valid</Button>
```

## Using never type:

What if there is a better way? I don’t really want a variant prop…
What I want is to simply say if my button is primary or secondary .

Let’s see how to do it

```ts
type SecondaryButton = React.ComponentProps<"button"> & {
  secondary: boolean;
  primary?: never; // on this type primary shouldn't never be set
};

type PrimaryButton = React.ComponentProps<"button"> & {
  primary: boolean;
  secondary?: never; // this time, primary shouldn't be set
};

type ButtonProps = SecondaryButton | PrimaryButton;

export const Button = ({ primary, secondary, children, ...rest }: ButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <button {...rest}>
      {primary && "primary"} {secondary && "secondary"}
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

And we would use it like this:

```ts
<Button primary>I'm primary</Button>;
<Button secondary>I'm secondary</Button>;
```

While still having the same type safety:

```ts
// This shouldn't "compile":
<Button primary secondary>
  I'm not valid
</Button>
// Error: Type ‘{ children: string; primary: true; secondary: true; }’
// is not assignable to type ‘IntrinsicAttributes & ButtonProps’
```
