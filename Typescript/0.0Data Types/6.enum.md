### Many people call them the worst feature of the language

### TypeScript enums are not native to JavaScript.

### There is an ECMAScript proposal to bring Enums to JavaScript, but as of today, enums are not in JavaScript.

```txt
By default, enums will initialize the first value to 0 and add 1 to each additional value

enum CardinalDirections {
  North,
  East,
  South,
  West
};

let currentDirection = CardinalDirections.North;

// North is the first value so it logs '0'
console.log(currentDirection);

// throws error when commented in as 'North' is not a valid enum
// currentDirection = 'North';
// Error: "North" is not assignable to type 'CardinalDirections'.
```

```txt
Numeric enums

enum Direction {
  Up = 1,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}


String enums
enum Direction {
  Up = "UP",
  Down = "DOWN",
  Left = "LEFT",
  Right = "RIGHT",
}

Heterogeneous enums
Technically enums can be mixed with string and numeric members, but itâ€™s not clear why you would ever want to do so:

enum BooleanLikeHeterogeneousEnum {
  No = 0,
  Yes = "YES",
}
```

## One way is by using POJOs (or plain old JavaScript objects),

```js

const FruitEnumPojo = {
  APPLE: "apple",
  BANANA: "banana",
  MANGO: "mango",
} as const;
```

## Objects vs Enums

```js

const enum EDirection {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}

const ODirection = {
  Up: 0,
  Down: 1,
  Left: 2,
  Right: 3,
} as const;

EDirection.Up;


// Using the enum as a parameter
function walk(dir: EDirection) {}

// It requires an extra line to pull out the values
type Direction = typeof ODirection[keyof typeof ODirection];
function run(dir: Direction) {}

walk(EDirection.Left);
run(ODirection.Right);
```
