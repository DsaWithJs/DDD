When working with TypeScript, Jest provides several methods to facilitate mocking in a way that is type-safe and compatible with TypeScript's static typing. These methods help ensure that mocks adhere to the types of the functions or modules they're replacing, improving developer experience and code reliability. Here's an overview of mock-related methods and concepts in Jest that are particularly relevant when using TypeScript:

### 1. jest.fn()

`jest.fn()` creates a new mock function. When used with TypeScript, you can provide a type for the mock function to ensure it matches the signature of the function you're mocking. This is useful for standalone functions or for specifying callback types.

```typescript
const myMockFunction: jest.Mock<number, [string, number]> = jest.fn((str, num) => num);
```

### 2. jest.mock()

`jest.mock()` is used to automatically mock entire modules. In TypeScript, when you mock a module, TypeScript will still type-check your interactions with the mock against the original module's type definitions. This helps ensure that your mocks adhere to the expected types.

To provide specific types for module mocks or to extend the types of the jest mocks, you might need to use module augmentation or declare the types explicitly:

```typescript
// Explicitly declaring mock types
jest.mock("./myModule", () => ({
  myFunction: jest.fn(() => "mocked value"),
}));

import { myFunction } from "./myModule";
const myFunctionMock = myFunction as jest.MockedFunction<typeof myFunction>;
```

### 3. jest.spyOn()

`jest.spyOn()` creates a mock function for spying on the behavior of a method within an object. TypeScript will enforce that the spy is created on a method that actually exists on the object, maintaining type safety.

```typescript
const video = {
  play: () => "playing",
};

const spy = jest.spyOn(video, "play");
video.play();
expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

### 4. Type Utilities for Mocks

TypeScript provides several utilities that are useful when working with mocks, such as `jest.MockedFunction`, `jest.MockedClass`, and `jest.Mocked`. These utilities can be used to type your mock variables, ensuring they adhere to the structure of the original types but with each function being a Jest mock function:

```typescript
import * as myModule from "./myModule";

const mockedMyModule = myModule as jest.Mocked<typeof myModule>;
```

### 5. jest.mocked()

Jest 27 introduced a utility function `jest.mocked()` that is specifically designed to work with TypeScript. It wraps a module or object and returns it as a type that has all its methods and properties set to jest mock functions, while retaining the original types. This is especially useful for ensuring type safety when interacting with mocked modules or objects.

```typescript
import { myFunction } from "./myModule";
jest.mock("./myModule");

const mockedMyFunction = jest.mocked(myFunction);
```

### Conclusion

When using Jest with TypeScript, leveraging these methods and utilities allows you to maintain the benefits of TypeScript's static typing while fully utilizing Jest's mocking capabilities. This combination ensures that your tests are both type-safe and effective, providing confidence in the behavior and integration of your TypeScript applications.
