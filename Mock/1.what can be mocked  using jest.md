Using Jest, you can mock a wide variety of entities in your JavaScript or TypeScript code to isolate your tests, control the environment, and ensure your unit tests are focused and reliable. Here are the primary types of entities you can mock with Jest:

### 1. Functions

- **Standalone Functions**: Create mock functions to replace standalone or utility functions. This allows you to control return values, implement custom logic for tests, and inspect calls to the function.
- **Method Functions**: Mock methods of objects or classes, allowing you to test interactions with these methods without relying on their actual implementations.

### 2. Modules

- **Node Modules**: Mock Node.js core modules (e.g., `fs`, `http`) or third-party modules from `node_modules`. This is particularly useful for controlling external dependencies and avoiding side effects in tests.
- **ES Modules and CommonJS Modules**: Mock both default and named exports from ES Modules or CommonJS modules, enabling you to isolate your tests from other parts of your codebase or external libraries.

### 3. Classes

- **Constructor Functions and Classes**: Mock entire classes, allowing you to replace instances with mock instances. This includes controlling constructor behavior, mocking instance methods, and verifying interactions with the class.
- **Class Instances**: Create mock instances of classes manually or automatically to test interactions without relying on the real implementations of those classes.

### 4. Timers

- **Jest Timers**: Use Jest's fake timers to mock JavaScript timers (e.g., `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`). This allows you to simulate the passage of time, trigger timed functions instantly, and test time-dependent code without real delays.

### 5. Web APIs

- **DOM and Browser APIs**: Mock browser-specific APIs, such as the DOM API, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and others. This enables you to simulate browser environments in Node.js-based tests.
- **Fetch API and XMLHttpRequest**: Mock network requests and responses, allowing you to test your API interactions without making real HTTP requests.

### 6. System Resources

- **File System**: Mock the file system for tests that interact with file reading/writing operations, avoiding the need to access the real file system during tests.
- **Environment Variables**: Mock `process.env` to test code that behaves differently based on environment variables without having to change the actual environment settings.

### 7. Manual Mocks

- **Custom Behaviors**: Create manual mocks for modules or entities when you need more control over their behavior than automatic mocking provides. This is useful for complex scenarios where the default mock implementation isn't sufficient.

### 8. Partial Mocks

- **Partial Mocking**: Jest allows you to partially mock modules or objects, where you mock some parts (e.g., certain functions or methods) while keeping the rest of the behavior real. This is useful when you want to isolate certain aspects of a module but test the rest as it is.

### Utilizing Mocks Effectively

Jest's mocking capabilities are extensive, providing tools and functions to cover almost any mocking scenario you might encounter. The key to effective mocking is to use it to isolate your tests, making them deterministic and focused. By mocking dependencies and external interactions, you can ensure your tests are reliable, fast, and independent of external factors, leading to a more stable and maintainable codebase.
