Mocking standalone functions in Jest can be done in several ways, depending on how these functions are used or imported in your code. Hereâ€™s a guide on how to mock standalone functions, including both named exports and default exports in modules.

### Mocking Named Export Functions

Suppose you have a module with a named export function that you want to mock:

```javascript
// math.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

#### Test File: Mocking and Using the Named Export Function

```javascript
// Import the module and the function you want to mock
import * as math from "./math";

// Mock the entire module
jest.mock("./math", () => ({
  ...jest.requireActual("./math"), // This imports the actual implementations of other exports
  add: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(10), // Mock specific implementation
}));

test("adds two numbers", () => {
  expect(math.add(1, 2)).toBe(10);
  expect(math.add).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

This approach replaces the `add` function with a mock function that returns `10`, regardless of the input arguments, while keeping the original implementations of any other exported functions or values.

### Mocking Default Export Functions

For a module that exports a function as its default export:

```javascript
// add.js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export default add;
```

#### Test File: Mocking and Using the Default Export Function

```javascript
// Import the function you want to mock
import add from "./add";

// Mock the module using jest.mock
jest.mock("./add", () => ({
  __esModule: true, // This property is needed to mock ES module default exports
  default: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(10), // Mock specific implementation for default export
}));

test("adds two numbers", () => {
  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(10); // The mock implementation is used
  expect(add).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1); // Verify that the mock function was called
});
```

### Mocking Standalone Functions Without Module Imports

If you have a standalone function in the same file that you're testing, or you're passing functions around and want to mock them directly (e.g., as callback arguments), you can create a mock function using `jest.fn()` directly in your test:

```javascript
const standaloneMock = jest.fn().mockReturnValue(10);

test("uses standalone mock function", () => {
  const result = standaloneMock(1, 2);
  expect(result).toBe(10);
  expect(standaloneMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

This method is useful for mocking callback functions or when you have functions passed as arguments that you want to replace with mock implementations.

### Resetting and Clearing Mocks

Remember, Jest mock functions keep track of calls and results, so it's often necessary to reset or clear this state before or after tests to avoid test interference:

- **`.mockClear()`**: Clears all information about calls and results, but keeps the mock implementation.
- **`.mockReset()`**: Resets the mock function, clearing calls, results, and implementation.
- **`.mockRestore()`**: Restores the original function when using `jest.spyOn()` to mock. It's useful for built-in JavaScript functions or methods from node modules.

Using Jest to mock standalone functions allows you to isolate your tests, making them more reliable and focused on the unit of work being tested, rather than their dependencies.
