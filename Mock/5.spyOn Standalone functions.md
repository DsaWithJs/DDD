Using `jest.spyOn` on standalone functions directly is not straightforward because `jest.spyOn` requires an object and a property keyâ€”essentially, it is designed to spy on methods of objects. If you attempt to use `jest.spyOn` on a function that is not a method of an object, you'll encounter issues because there's no object to attach the spy to.

However, you can still test standalone functions in a similar manner by incorporating a workaround. If you have a standalone function that you wish to spy on without altering its implementation or if it's not feasible to directly modify the function to be a method on an object, consider the following strategies:

### Wrapping the Function in an Object

One common approach is to wrap the standalone function in an object for the purpose of testing. This allows you to use `jest.spyOn` with that object.

For example, if you have a standalone function:

```javascript
// math.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

You can create a wrapper in your test file or a test helper file:

```javascript
import * as math from "./math";

const mathWrapper = {
  add: math.add,
};

jest.spyOn(mathWrapper, "add");

mathWrapper.add(1, 2);

expect(mathWrapper.add).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

This approach modifies how you import and use the function in your tests but doesn't require changing the original implementation.

### Mocking the Module with jest.mock

For modules exporting standalone functions, another approach is to mock the entire module and then provide custom implementations or assertions. This doesn't use `jest.spyOn` but achieves a similar outcome by controlling and inspecting the function's behavior:

```javascript
import * as math from "./math";

jest.mock("./math", () => ({
  add: jest.fn().mockImplementation((a, b) => a + b),
}));

// Now `math.add` is a mock function
math.add(1, 2);

expect(math.add).toHaveBeenCalled();
expect(math.add).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1, 2);
expect(math.add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
```

### Conclusion

Directly using `jest.spyOn` on standalone functions isn't possible without first associating the function with an object. By wrapping the function in an object or using module mocking, you can achieve a similar effect, allowing you to spy on or mock the standalone function's calls, arguments, and return values. These techniques enable you to test functions in isolation, ensuring that your unit tests are focused and effective.
