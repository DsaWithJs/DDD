Question about React application,
I have a node package, named mrv-context-provider, which contains a context provider .
I have another package, name mrv-search,
I'm using both package in my app.
when I try to access mrv-context-provider in mrv-search using useContext and try to access values from mrv-context-provider , getting undefiend

It sounds like you're encountering an issue where the `mrv-search` package isn't able to correctly access the context values provided by `mrv-context-provider` when using the `useContext` hook in React. Here are several steps and checks you can perform to troubleshoot and hopefully resolve this issue:

### 1. Verify Context Import

Ensure that the context from `mrv-context-provider` is being imported correctly into `mrv-search`. An incorrect path or misnamed export can lead to the context being `undefined`.

```javascript
import { MyContext } from "mrv-context-provider"; // Ensure correct export name and source
```

### 2. Check Provider Scope

The component using the context (from `mrv-search`) needs to be within the scope of the `MyContext.Provider` from `mrv-context-provider`. If `mrv-search` components are outside the provider's scope, they won't have access to the context values.

```jsx
import { MyContextProvider } from "mrv-context-provider";
import { SearchComponent } from "mrv-search";

function App() {
  return (
    <MyContextProvider>
      <SearchComponent /> // Ensure this is within the Provider scope
    </MyContextProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Verify Context Values

Ensure that the `MyContext.Provider` in `mrv-context-provider` is initialized correctly with valid values that are not `undefined`. It's possible the context is setup but no valid values are being passed down.

```javascript
<MyContext.Provider value={{ someValue: "hello" }}>
  {" "}
  // Ensure values are not undefined
  {children}
</MyContext.Provider>
```

### 4. useContext Usage

Check how `useContext` is used in `mrv-search`. You should be directly passing the context object to `useContext` without any alterations.

```javascript
import { useContext } from "react";
import { MyContext } from "mrv-context-provider";

function useMyValue() {
  const context = useContext(MyContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error("useMyValue must be used within a MyContextProvider");
  }
  return context;
}
```

### 5. Duplicate React Instances

If both packages are using their own React instances (common in mono-repos or when linking packages locally), this can cause issues with hooks like `useContext`. Ensure that there's only one React and ReactDOM instance in your node_modules by checking the installed packages and using resolutions if necessary.

```bash
npm ls react
npm ls react-dom
```

If you see multiple versions, you might need to align them in your `package.json` using the `resolutions` field (for yarn) or manually aligning your versions.

### 6. Build and Linking Errors

If you're using local packages or symlinks, sometimes the build process can cause issues with context being recognized across packages. Ensure your build process transpiles the packages correctly, and consider using something like `npm link` or workspaces properly.

By following these checks, you should be able to diagnose why `useContext` is returning `undefined`. If you need further assistance, providing more specific code snippets or setup details could help pinpoint the issue.

## both packages are using separate react instaces of same version because of mono-repos

Having separate React instances, even if they are the same version, can indeed cause issues with React context, as React hooks (like `useContext`) rely on the React context being the same across your application. This is a common issue in monorepos or when using linked packages. Here are some steps to ensure that both packages use the same React instance:

### 1. Peer Dependencies

Make sure that `React` and `ReactDOM` are set as peer dependencies in your packages (`mrv-context-provider` and `mrv-search`). This means they won't each bundle their own React but will rely on the React version installed in the consuming application. Here’s an example of how you can define this in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.0" // Adjust according to your React version
  }
}
```

### 2. Use Workspaces

If you are using a tool like Yarn or npm that supports workspaces, configure your monorepo to use a single version of React across all workspaces. This helps to ensure that all packages use the same React instance. In your root `package.json`, you can configure it like this:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"],
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 3. Resolutions Field

If you're using Yarn, you can use the `resolutions` field to force resolutions of React to a single version across all packages in your monorepo. Add this to your root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "**/react": "^17.0.0",
    "**/react-dom": "^17.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 4. npm Dedupe

For npm users, ensuring that npm deduplicates dependencies can help. Running `npm dedupe` might align your React versions to use a single copy.

### 5. Check Symlinks

If you are using `npm link` or `yarn link` to link local packages, sometimes React might still end up duplicated. One workaround is to link React itself:

```bash
cd path/to/your/react
npm link
cd path/to/mrv-context-provider
npm link react
cd path/to/mrv-search
npm link react
```

### 6. Validate Single React Instance

After applying these configurations, validate that your application is using a single React instance:

```bash
npm ls react
```

or for Yarn:

```bash
yarn why react
```

This command shows which versions of React are installed and why, helping you ensure that there's only one instance.

By addressing the issue with these steps, your React context should work correctly across different packages in the monorepo.

## does react hooks and context needs same instance of react ?

Yes, React hooks and context need the same instance of React to function correctly across different components and packages. Here’s why:

### Single React Instance Requirement

React relies on a shared internal state to manage components, hooks, and contexts. When different parts of your application use different instances of React, they each maintain separate internal states. This separation causes several issues:

1. **Context Inconsistency**: Contexts rely on React's internal state to pass data down the component tree. If different parts of your application are using different React instances, they cannot access the same context state. As a result, components using a different instance of React than the one where the context was created will not be able to see the context value and will receive the default value instead, or `undefined` if no default is provided.

2. **Invalid Hook Calls**: React hooks must follow specific rules regarding their calling context. Using different React instances can lead to invalid hook calls because the internal state management and lifecycle processes of hooks are tied to the specific instance of React that executes them.

3. **Component Reconciliation Issues**: Each React instance has its own reconciliation process (the algorithm React uses to update the DOM). If components rendered by different React instances interact, you might encounter problems with component updates and state management.

### Ensuring a Single React Instance

To avoid these issues, especially in complex setups like monorepos or when using external libraries and linked packages, it's crucial to ensure that all parts of your application use the same React instance. This includes React hooks and context providers/consumers. The common approaches to achieve this are:

- **Using Peer Dependencies**: By specifying React as a peer dependency in libraries, you ensure that they use the React version provided by the host application rather than bundling their own.

- **Workspace Configuration**: Tools like Yarn or npm with workspaces can help manage a single React version across multiple packages in a monorepo.

- **Symlinking React**: In development setups, especially when using `npm link` or `yarn link`, manually linking the React library to ensure that all packages use the same instance can help resolve issues.

By maintaining a single instance of React across your entire application, you can prevent many common bugs related to context and hooks, ensuring a more stable and predictable React application.

## what else will be stored in react instance

The React instance, typically referenced through an import of React in your JavaScript files, encapsulates a range of functionalities and state management features that are crucial for developing and managing React applications. Here are the key elements stored and managed within a React instance:

### 1. **Component Lifecycle State**

React manages the state of component lifecycles, including the mounting, updating, and unmounting phases. This state management ensures that components behave predictably throughout their lifecycle events, triggering re-renders and updates appropriately.

### 2. **Hooks State**

For functional components using hooks, React keeps track of hooks' state. This includes state variables from `useState`, effects from `useEffect`, contexts from `useContext`, and other hooks like `useReducer` or `useMemo`. The ordering and storage of these hooks are critical and must be consistent across renders, which is why all hooks must follow the rules of hooks.

### 3. **Contexts**

React uses its instance to handle the provisioning and consumption of contexts defined via `React.createContext()`. Each context provider can have its value, which is passed down to any consuming components. The same instance of React must manage the provider and its consumers to ensure that the context values are correctly passed and updated throughout the component tree.

### 4. **Reconciliation Algorithm**

The React instance includes the reconciliation algorithm—React's mechanism for diffing the old and new component trees to determine the minimal set of changes to the DOM. This process is essential for optimizing updates and ensuring that the UI reflects the current state of the application.

### 5. **Refs Management**

React manages refs (references to DOM nodes or React elements) that are created using `React.createRef()` or `useRef()`. The management of these refs allows React components to directly interact with DOM nodes and other elements efficiently.

### 6. **Event Handling**

React abstracts the native browser event system into a synthetic event system, which is consistent across different browsers. React's instance handles the pooling and delegation of these synthetic events, optimizing performance and cross-browser compatibility.

### 7. **Scheduler and Prioritization**

Recent versions of React, especially with the introduction of concurrent features, include a scheduler that helps prioritize updates. This means React can interrupt and resume work based on the priority of updates, which is critical for maintaining smooth user experiences even during large updates.

### 8. **Development Tools Integration**

React integrates with development tools such as the React Developer Tools extension, which provides deep insights into component trees, their current props, state, context, and performance profiling. This integration is facilitated by the React instance managing detailed component metadata.

Ensuring that all these functionalities are sourced from a single React instance in your application is crucial for maintaining consistent behavior, especially when using complex features like context and hooks. If multiple React instances are used, it can lead to discrepancies and bugs due to separate instances managing different parts of your application state and behavior.

## when can we use 2 separate instances of react

Using two separate instances of React in a single application is generally not recommended because it can lead to various issues such as inconsistent component lifecycle management, context sharing problems, and hook misbehaviors. However, there are specific scenarios where you might end up using separate instances of React, either intentionally or due to certain constraints:

### 1. **Isolated Micro-Frontends**

In a micro-frontend architecture, different parts of a larger application are built and deployed independently by different teams. Each micro-frontend might use its own version of React, especially if they are isolated within iframes or are served from different domains. This setup helps prevent runtime conflicts and dependencies between teams but does not allow for direct interaction between React instances.

### 2. **Embedding External Applications**

If you are embedding third-party applications or widgets into your site, these might come with their own React instance. For instance, a chatbot or customer feedback widget provided by a third-party service could be running a different version of React, encapsulated within a shadow DOM or iframe.

### 3. **Gradual Upgrades**

In large applications, upgrading the React version can be a massive undertaking. Sometimes, parts of the application might be temporarily running different versions during a migration phase. This scenario should be handled carefully to avoid long-term dependency on multiple React versions.

### 4. **Legacy Support**

Older sections of an application that have not yet been upgraded or refactored might run on an older React version, while newer developments use the latest React. Again, these should ideally be isolated (e.g., through iframes) to prevent interference between different React instances.

### 5. **Testing and Experimentation**

Sometimes, for testing or experimental purposes, you might want to compare the behavior of components under different React versions. This setup is usually temporary and limited to development environments.

### Best Practices for Using Multiple React Instances

If you find yourself needing to use multiple React instances, consider the following best practices to minimize potential issues:

- **Isolation**: Use iframes or shadow DOM to isolate React instances from each other. This prevents them from interfering in each other’s DOM and state management.
- **Boundary Management**: Define clear boundaries for each React instance. For instance, one React instance should manage one subtree of the application, and another instance manages a different subtree.
- **Communication**: Use browser events, message passing, or other mechanisms to communicate between instances if necessary, rather than relying on shared state or context.
- **Clean Up**: Ensure that each React instance properly cleans up its resources, particularly for things like global event listeners or intervals, to prevent memory leaks.

By carefully managing the scenarios where multiple React instances are used, you can minimize the risk of bugs and ensure a more stable application environment.
